## 1. Link Existing Documents to Jobs

**What Changed:**
- Users can now connect existing invoices, estimates, or agreements to any job
- A new "Associate Document" option appears in the job menu (three dots)
- The menu label automatically shows what type of document the job was created from:

  - Jobs from estimates show "Associate Estimate"
  - Jobs from agreements show "Associate Agreement"

**How It Works:**
- Tap the three-dot menu on any job card
- Select the "Associate" option
- Choose from your existing documents
- The modal only shows the relevant document type (e.g., if the job came from an invoice, you'll only see invoices to choose from)
- Documents already linked to the job show a "Linked" badge
- Documents linked to other jobs show which job they're connected to

**Benefits:**
- Connect multiple invoices to a single job
- Keep all related documents organized in one place
- Easy to find and link documents without creating new ones
